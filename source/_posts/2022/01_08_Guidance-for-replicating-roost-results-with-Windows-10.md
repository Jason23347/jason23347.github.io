> **R**epresentati**o**n Learning fr**o**m **St**oichiometry (Roost) is a python implementation of [this paper](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-020-19964-7).
> Dependencies for Linux was provided in [GitHub readme](https://github.com/CompRhys/roost).
> However, there's only a easy environment setup guide for Linux with `cudatoolkit=11.1`.
> It was not tested by the author that whether it is possible to run the codes using Windows with newer cudatookit (currently 11.5).

### Requirements

```yml
System: Windows 10
Python: Anaconda
Cuda: cudatoolkit 11.5
```

### Environment Setup

#### Create a New Conda Environment

Create a new environment and activate it.

```sh
conda create --name roost python=3.8
conda activate roost
```

#### Install PyTorch

And then install newest PyTorch.
Code shown below was generated by [PyTorch's website](https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/).

```sh
pip install torch==1.10.1+cu113 torchvision==0.11.2+cu113 torchaudio===0.10.1+cu113 -f https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu113/torch_stable.html
```

You can also use `conda` here instead of `pip`.
But it is easier for me to setup a proxy with `pip --proxy="http://host:port"`.
I have no idea about how to set my proxy for conda.

#### Install Torch-Scatter

```sh
pip install torch-scatter torch-sparse torch-cluster torch-spline-conv torch-geometric -f https://data.pyg.org/whl/torch-1.10.0+cu113.html
```

Code above was generated by [Torch-Scatter's website](https://pytorch-geometric.readthedocs.io/en/latest/notes/installation.html).

#### Other Dependencies

The list of all the other dependencies are available in `requirements.txt`.
Just install them with a simple command:

```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
